# 100 Days Of Unity

Repo to track my progress for completing the 100 Days of Unity challenge.

I will have different ReadMe files showing my progress for each tutorial or book I complete. I will have my progress tracked with a check list for each tutorial or book I complete. As I finish a section or exercise I will check off the area and place the date of completion on the same line.

**Goals:**
1. Code for at least 1hr a day
2. Be able to show something that "works" each day
3. Post progress on Medium with tag 100 Days of Unity
4. Record completed areas on Github in Markdown checklist
5. Tweet progress with the hashtag #100DaysOfUnity
6. Try not to miss more than 2 days in a row (The hardest rule to follow!)
