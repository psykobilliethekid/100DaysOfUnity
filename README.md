# 100 Days Of Unity
**Repo to track my progress for completing the 100 Days of Unity challenge.**
___
## Motivation
I've been wanting to get back into making games in Unity3D for some time. Going off of my (mostly!) successful pattern of coding everyday for the [100 Days Of Code challenge](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code), I decided to create my own challenge of 100 Days of Unity. I'm really hoping to make some awesome games and have a decent library of stuff to show off once the challenge is complete.

## Synopsis
For 100 days, I will work on something in Unity and post my progress on Github, Medium, and Twitter. I'll be using a mix of online tutorials from Udemy and YouTube, as well as ebooks I have found that go over something I am interesting in making in Unity. I'm going to use [a technique my fellow 100 Days Of Code challenge members came up with](https://twitter.com/pilifdz/status/962853781036703744), and will create a check box list of all the parts of the video or book that I complete and show the date of their completion. 

I'll have individual Markdown files for each source I use to complete my work in Unity. This will also help for others who would like to use the same resource in the future.

## Goals
1. Code for at least 1hr a day
2. Be able to show something that "works" each day
3. Post progress on Medium with tag 100 Days of Unity
4. Record completed areas on Github in Markdown checklist
5. Tweet progress with the hashtag [#100DaysOfUnity](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfUnity&src=typd)
6. Try not to miss more than 2 days in a row (The hardest rule to follow!)
